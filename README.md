# Build-a-Patent-Search-App-with-Spanner-Vector-Search-Gemini-1.0-Pro-
Revolutionize patent searches using Spanner and Gemini 1.0 Pro. Faster, intuitive, and precise. Avoid infringement. 🚀🔍📚
1. Overview
Across different industries, Patent research is a critical tool for understanding the competitive landscape, identifying potential licensing or acquisition opportunities, and avoiding infringing on existing patents.

Patent research is vast and complex. Sifting through countless technical abstracts to find relevant innovations is a daunting task. Traditional keyword-based searches are often inaccurate and time-consuming. Abstracts are lengthy and technical, making it difficult to grasp the core idea quickly. This can lead to researchers missing key patents or wasting time on irrelevant results.

2.Objective
In this project, we will work towards making the process of searching for patents faster, more intuitive, and incredibly precise by leveraging Spanner, and in-place Gemini 1.0 Pro, Embeddings and Vector Search.

What is built
As part of project:
1.Create a Spanner instance
2.Load a Google Patents Public Datasets
3.Create a remote model for text embeddings with Gemini 1.0 Pro model
4.Create generative insights from loaded dataset
5.Generate embeddings from the insights
6.Issue similarity search queries against the dataset
